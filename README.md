__GETTING STARTED:__

Get familiar with the signal flow diagram, what each component does, and the functions/application of an audio interface.
I'll add a video or two to the Refs doc, and I'll put together a brief overview soon.

_Pick a Subteam_

1. DSP
   - Use Vivado Design Suite/Verilog to create digital effects like reverb, delay, compression, etc
   - Some musical background helps, especially music production but not necessary by any means
2. Circuit Design
   - Use SPICE software (Altium, Multisim, etc.) to design and simulate high quality DAC and ADC
   - Construct circuits for preamps (op-amp, fet, tube emulation)
   - Prior experience with circuit design/Boolean logic helps, but this can all be learned relatively quickly
*Not necessarily limited to one subteam
